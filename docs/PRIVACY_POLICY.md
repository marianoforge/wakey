# Privacy Policy - Wakey

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Introduction

Wakey ("we", "our", or "the app") is a drowsiness detection application designed to help drivers stay alert while driving. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.

## Information We Collect

### Camera Access
Wakey requires access to your device's front-facing camera to detect signs of drowsiness (such as eye closure patterns) while you drive. 

**Important:** All camera processing happens **locally on your device**. We do NOT:
- Capture, store, or save any photos or videos
- Send any images or facial data to external servers
- Use facial recognition to identify you
- Share any visual data with third parties

The camera feed is processed in real-time using on-device machine learning (ML Kit) and is immediately discarded after analysis.

### Data We Do NOT Collect
- Personal identification information
- Location data
- Driving history
- Photos or videos
- Contact information
- Usage analytics

## Data Storage

Wakey may store basic session statistics locally on your device (such as session duration and alert counts). This data:
- Remains on your device only
- Is not transmitted to any server
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the app

## Third-Party Services

Wakey uses Google ML Kit for on-device face detection. ML Kit processes all data locally and does not send facial data to Google servers. For more information, see [Google ML Kit's Privacy Policy](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms).

## Children's Privacy

Wakey is not intended for use by children under 18 years old, as it is designed for licensed drivers.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
